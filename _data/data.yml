    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Programming has always been a passion of mine since I started coding in grade 10, making simple calculator and tutor programs on Netbeans.
      The thing I love about programming is that you have the ability to create something from nothing that can help make other's lives easier.

        conference: From March 2017 to November 2017 our student group of four students had to spend 40 hours each of community service for a university module named JCP 202. The main objective of our team was to preserve over 260 old documents in the office of General Jan Smuts by scanning the files into PDF documents and digitally organizing them into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. This project was a University of Pretoria driven program to give back to our surrounding communities.
